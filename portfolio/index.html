          <p>  
          I graduated from my Bachelor of Fine Arts, Design at YSDN in Toronto in 2016.
          Since then, I've been working as a designer for clients across Canada.
          </p>
          <p>
          In 2019, I founded <a href="https://untitleddesign.studio" target="_blank"><b>Untitled Design Studio</b></a>
          with my partner, offering strategy and design services.
          </p>
          <p>
          Today, I live in Montreal with my partner, where I've moved my complete attention to a career in Game Development.
          I've been learning and exploring game design & 3D art, participating in Game Jams, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
          In my free time I practice <a href="https://prismism.substack.com">creative writing</a>, <a href="https://tzionet.bandcamp.com">music production</a>, apparel & graphic design, UI, 3D & 2D art and programming.

                  Pile Up was designed to be a compulsive match-4 where players have to sort packages into their corresponding delivery truck. 
                  Players are awarded 100 points on matching crates with trucks. 
                  On mismatches or expired boxes, players lose time. At 4 positive matches, players receive a bonus 1000 points and time, 
                  the full truck leaves, and a new truck drives in. This is where the tension of the game comes from - the player is relatively 
                  quick and can match objects easily. If there was a wrong match, it would most likely be from an input error rather than confusion. 
                  By design, this balance and reward structure allows a skilled player to play the game in perpetuity, raking in time with fullloads. 
                  But this quick-fire, constant matching means when they're receiving packages for trucks they can't match, they're eagerly waiting, 
                  painfully even, for a matching color to finish a combo and get a new truck to clear their stack of packages and keep the timer going. 
                  By keeping the pace high, and making players beg for the right crate, players would be clearing trucks quicker and quicker, and eventually 
                  get to a point where they start making errors.

                    While I continue to revisit Pile Up, in order to bring it to a full 1.0 release, this version is a fair approximation of my intent for it.
                    The game is relatively compulsive, and some SFX exist to give a bit of the ~sparkle~ that makes a game like this fun and pavlovian-inly rewarding. 
                    In its current iteration, there is still a ton of feedback required to make it truly the brain-pleasing experience of our favorite arcade games, 
                    and additional mechanics/balance changes are needed to keep it feeling fair and challenging for highly skilled players. The dedicated player will
                    quickly reach a challenge plateau where the game will stop being challenging and therefore engaging, and the meta-game may still need some exposing for the new player to learn.

                <h2>LEARNINGS</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Done is better than broken.</li>
                    <li>Define what's needed LONG before production.</li>
                    <li>Feel is as critical as playable.</li>
                  </ul> 
                  <p>
                    Perhaps the largest lessons I learned from this game is to do with Balance and Fun.
                    Particularly, the difference FX makes to enjoyment and when/where/how balance needs to be adjusted. 
                    The first 'complete' version of the game simply wasn't fun, due to lack of FX and too clean a balance. 
                    Rewards were too frequent, and penalties too mild, considering how much control the player has. 
                    By turning minor rewards into sound effects instead of game time, and tying game time rewards only to larger successes (full loads), the game became much more rewarding, and the meta started to reveal itself (it's about loads, not just matches). By making penalties more punishing in time and adding elements the player can't control, like trucks leaving on their own (a mechanic never originally intended), a new layer of tension (and meta-game) was added. A dual-edge emerges, where the player can try and predict truck dispatches at risk of expiring crates. A bad prediction can mean 5 or more seconds taken off the clock from expired crates, but a good prediction can mean 5 or more seconds added for free by a pre-loaded stack of crates. These changes allowed more momentum and swings from success to failure to be more dramatic, making the game more emotionally gripping.

                Originally conceived as a small cylinder map where players would be facing each other early, the design developed into 2 main levels, with interstitial levels from supports, bridges, stairwells, and central locations. 
                The theme eventually settled on a mysterious reactor or generator room with scripted elements in the centre.

              <p>
               About 8 or 9 years ago, I was contributing to a Zine a friend in design school had started.
               we're both very much into dystopian/cyberpunk fiction and theory, and the magazine was meant to cover topics related, as well as the 'internet' culture that we were fully immersed in and a part of.
               I've always been a writer, and one of my contributions was a short story I called "Verisimilis".
               This short story was intended to be a first chapter of a larger story, but I was never able to really get to the next chapter, until I began to think of it as interactive.
               Once I had reframed the story as a game, the opportunities began unfolding before me.
               Verisimilis quickly became the first area of a prototype I wanted to develop. I then went to Inkle to make it interactive and start experimenting with the new world that had emerged.

              <p>
                "RECEIVER" is a concept shooter I've been developing a prototype for in my spare time. While I have many years experience in UI and design, I don't have much in programming. So when I find myself stumped in Unity, I turn to other areas to offload my ideas. The RECEIVER UI, much like the Halo UI's before it, are designed to simplify the user experience while also affording them flexibility. A key feature of RECEIVER is the ability to switch between a live practice mode and the main menu at any given time.
                Using a tab/folder layout, and a switcher concept, the menu allows players to always be in the core game experience while searching for games, practicing, customizing or socializing. This prototype was designed to better understand the organization and animation of the menu, and to test the new concepts I was playing with.

              <p>
                Halo Infinite is my favorite game so I spent a lot of time intimately interacting with it's UI and so it's limitations became apparent to me quickly. Not to mention Halo once held a very high position in the world of video game UI, even setting the standard for how console games would work from then on with Halo 2.
                For that reason, I decided to take a crack at, in order to practice the balancing act of having a lot features - many of which that interact with each other.

              <h2>CONCEPT & THEME</h2>
              <p>
                The Xbox Home Screen has been a controversial topic amongst gamers since it's first iteration. And while I've always been fine to let sleeping dogs lie - I couldn't help myself this time.
                I wanted to create something that was more focused on what consoles are good for - playing games and connecting you to other players. All while respecting and highlighting the importance of the 
                TV screen.

                <p>
                  In 2015(!!), I designed this interface in order to deliver a more engaging and responsive watching experience. I imagined an interface that used gestures for navigation and hidden tags/keywords as the content delivery. Users would be able to swipe their screen in any direction to reveal another video (hypothetically, from their youtube suggestions), and upon releasing, the video would start to play. 
                  With a pinch or an expand gesture, they'd be able to see the primary elements of that video, i.e. the Keywords it was tagged with or the suggestions Youtube would make to go with it. This way, users would not have to type to keep watching. They could follow their interests deep down the rabbit hole, finding more of what they like. The concept tries to leverage a 3D spatial environment, hypothetically granting an instinctual understanding of where they were at any given time. 
                  Looking back today, who would have thought, that the way to displace Youtube was with a SINGLE gesture(a swipe up or down)? Ah, Tiktok, you magical beast.
