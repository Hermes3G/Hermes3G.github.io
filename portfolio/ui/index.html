              <h2>CONCEPT & THEME</h2>
              <p>
                In 2015(!!), when I designed this interface, Youtube was the dominant mobile viewer. I remember a few other things had come about to try and deliver video content on your phones, but all of them had the same problem. You had to know what you wanted to watch next or trust their suggestions.
                In order to combat this, and deliver a more engaged watching experience that leveraged the existing tools in Youtube, tags, I created an interface that used gestures and hidden tags/keywords as the primary interactions. Users would be able to swipe their screen in any direction to reveal another video (hypothetically, from their youtube suggestions), and upon releasing, the video would start to play. 
                With a pinch or a expand gesture, they'd be able to see the primary elements of that video, i.e. the Keywords it was tagged with or the suggestions Youtube would make to go with it. This way, users would not have to type to keep watching. They could follow their interests deep down the rabbit hole, finding more of what they like, and by leveraging a 3D spatial environment, they would (again, hypothetically) have an instinctual understanding of where they were at any given time. 
                Looking back today, who would have thought, that the way to displace Youtube was not a better youtube, but a worse one, one where there was a SINGLE way to interact with it (a swipe up or down)? Ah, Tiktok, you magical beast.

              <p>
                The Xbox Home Screen has been a controversial topic amongst gamers since it's first iteration. And while I've always been fine to let sleeping dogs lie - I couldn't help myself this time.
                I wanted to create something that was more focused on what consoles are good for - playing games and connecting you to other players. All while respecting and highlighting the importance of the 
                TV screen.

              <p>
                Halo Infinite is my favorite game so I spent a lot of time intimately interacting with it's UI and so it's limitations became apparent to me quickly. Not to mention Halo once held a very high position in the world of video game UI, even setting the standard for how console games would work from then on with Halo 2.
                For that reason, I decided to take a crack at, in order to practice the balancing act of having a lot features - many of which that interact with each other.

              <h2>CONCEPT & THEME</h2>
              <p>
                "RECEIVER" is a concept shooter I've been developing a prototype for in my spare time. While I have many years experience in UI and design, I don't have much in programming. So when I find myself stumped in Unity, I turn to other areas to offload my ideas. The RECEIVER UI, much like the Halo UI's before it, are designed to simplify the user experience while also affording them flexibility. A key feature of RECEIVER is the ability to switch between a live practice mode and the main menu at any given time.
                Using a tab/folder layout, and a switcher concept, the menu allows players to always be in the core game experience while searching for games, practicing, customizing or socializing. This prototype was designed to better understand the organization and animation of the menu, and to test the new concepts I was playing with.
